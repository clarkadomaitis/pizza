      <p> Indoor dining was made legal in NYC on September 30, after over 6 months of being shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. The NYC restaurant industry has been devastated due to the closures. According to <a
          href="https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/osdc/pdf/nyc-restaurant-industry-final.pdf"> a report</a> from the NYS Comptroller, by August 2020, employment in the restaurant industry was only “55 percent of its level in February 2020,
        before the pandemic hit.”

      <p> All seven pizza places in the neighborhood have decided to open tables for indoor dining. As of March, pizza places have only been able to open for delivery, take-out, and outdoor dining. The grab-and-go mentality of pizza places has
        allowed them to function during the pandemic. Lenny and John’s in early September was even considering not participating in indoor dining. “It's not something that we want to inflict on our customers, having them forward over all their
        personal information, having to take their temperatures. It's not appropriate for the type of business that we do.”</p>

      <p> Marine Park is in one of the <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/1312799872920231940"> 11 zip codes</a>
        that Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on October 4 that are seeing increasing COVID-19 infections. The current 14-day positivity rate is 2.22% in the 11234 zip code. If Marine Park's numbers rise over 3%, they may see a shutdown of indoor
        dining
        and outdoor dining. </p>
